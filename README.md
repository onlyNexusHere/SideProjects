# SideProjects
These are small projects that make everything easier.

My favorite way to spend free time is to take classes in computer science (I took 7 classes in my free time, during high school, 4 for college credit and 1 class I didn't get credit for because I maxed out on college classes). So, most of previous projects were through classes, which should not be public on Github.
